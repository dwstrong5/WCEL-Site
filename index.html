        <div class="mission-statement">Whatcom Center for Early Learning's mission is to partner with families to provide high-quality, equitable, and comprehensive therapy and support services to children experiencing developmental delays and disabilities.</div></div>
    <div class="vision-statement-container">
        <div class="vision-title">Our Vision</div>
        <div class="vision-statement">We envision an equitable society where children with disabilities and their families thrive, experience meaningful connections, and have a deep understanding of their strengths and needs.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="mid-container">
        <div class="equitable-society-container-left">
            We define an 'equitable society' as a society in which we can no longer predict someone's outcomes (in terms of health, education attainment, the likelihood of incarceration, access to wealth, etc). based on their race, gender, disability status, or other social identifies that experience marginalization.
        </div>
        <div class="equitable-society-container-mid">
            Our mission statement is asserting that through the actions of WCEL, we will move closer to a world in which the needs of children and families are met so that there are fewer disparities in those long-term outcomes. <br><br> WCEL takes an equity approach in our work by serving children and families based on needs. We provide services for kids with delays and/or disabilities so they can grow and thrive, instead of offering equal servies for every child.
        </div>
        <div class="equitable-society-container-right">
            Using the phrase 'equitable society' in the mission puts this existing framework front and center and invites us to consider how WCEL can work to ensure that kids and families, within the group we exist to serve, who are most vulnerable to harm are centered in our work.
